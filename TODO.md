Things needed:

So much left to do, but some things that are needed soon to make this
usuable for musical applications:

- finish work on MIDI, including defining some polyphonic structure
- reverb
- larger goal might be to speed up ugen creation by having a plugin
framework
  - I'm thinking LV2 for this sepcifically, but could be that I can leverage
    some of the things already in things like Sporth.
